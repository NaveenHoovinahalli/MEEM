<p>Automatic Backup</p>
<p>After the first backup, whenever you connect MEEM to charge your device, backup will start automatically after a 20 second countdown.</p>
<p><img title="" src="images/AB00.png" style="width:100%; height:auto" /></p>
<p>If the contents on your device have changed more that 5%, MEEM will automatically alert you. This is to ensure that if you have erased a lot of information from your device, such as through a factory reset (which deletes all the data on your device), you want to perform&nbsp;the same deletion on your MEEM. </p>
<p>If you want to stop the backup and restore the data on your MEEM to your phone, press stop at the top of the screen and follow the directions below. </p>

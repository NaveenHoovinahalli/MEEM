<p>The MEEM Network allows you to backup data from any platform and access it from any platform, no matter the device or operating system.</p>
<p>The MEEM Network feature allows a user to use their MEEM iOS cable to backup an Android or Windows phone as there is no need to plug the cable into the device to back it up anymore. Conversely an Android MEEM cable can be used to backup an iPhone or Windows phone. The only requirement is you have at least one device which is the same as the cable type you have, ie with your iOS cable you have an iPhone or iPad to plug it into. You will then be able to backup other device types over the WIFI network.</p>
<p>Using MEEM desktop application, you can access all your cable’s contents without even connecting the cable to your Mac, Windows PC and Linux PC. You can even configure the MEEM desktop application to automatically copy your backup data from the MEEM cable to your desktop whenever the auto-backup of all the device’s data is finished.</p>

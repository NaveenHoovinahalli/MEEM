<p>Using the MEEM Computer Application </p>
<p>The MEEM Network allows you to have a second backup of all your device’s data saved on your computer. To do this you need to download and install the MEEM Desktop application. Please refer to the MEEM Desktop User Guide for complete instructions on downloading and installing the application. The MEEM Desktop User Guide and MEEM Desktop Application can be found on our Help page at the bottom under DOWNLOADS at https://www.meemmemory.com/help/</p>
<p>Once you have the MEEM Application installed on your computer you will need to:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Plug your MEEM cable into one of your devices and make sure the MEEM app is running</li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li>Make sure your computer is on the same WIFI network as your device</li>
</ul>
<p>Once you have done that open the MEEM app on your computer. The MEEM application on your computer will seek out the MEEM Network and connect to it automatically as long as it is enabled on at least the device connected to the MEEM cable. Once it has connected you will have the ability to select which devices and categories you would like backed up to your computer. This can be done under File – Settings. Once you have setup which devices you would like copied you will be able to exit the settings area.</p>
<p>The MEEM cable will backup the information on it to your computer once all your mobile devices connected to the MEEM Network have backed up. This means it is the last step to happen during the backup procedure. You will see the status of the backup on your Master Device’s screen and on the computer. This backup could take some time, especially on the first backup if you have multiple devices and a lot of data stored on the MEEM cable. Please note it may take up to a day to backup all the information to your MEEM cable the first time and another day for that data to be backed up to the computer, less time than the cloud takes though.
</p>
<p>Don’t worry if you unplug your device from the MEEM cable though or a phone goes out of range of the MEEM Network. The next time it’s reconnected to the cable or network the backup will resume where it left off.</p>
<p>To avoid having to wait it is recommended to do the backup in stages, leaving your device to backup and charge for as long as possible before using it. This will allow as much information as possible to be transferred to the MEEM cable and from the MEEM cable to the computer. For iOS slave devices backing up through the MEEM Network make sure the MEEM app is open on the device for the backup to run. Once the initial backup has completed subsequent backups will be significantly faster as the device is only copying over any new data.</p>

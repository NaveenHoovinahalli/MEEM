<p>How it Works </p>
<p>The MEEM Network is extremely easy to use. Plug the MEEM cable into one of your devices. This will become the Master Device and will start backing up to the cable as normal. At the same time the MEEM app will search the local WIFI network for any other devices with the MEEM app on them. If other devices are found they will receive a notification on screen. If notifications for MEEM are turned off, the MEEM app will need to be opened manually on slave devices. The MEEM app will then analyze and backup those devices to the MEEM cable over the WIFI as if they were connected to the cable itself.</p>
<p>The data is then safely stored on the MEEM cable without needing to plug it into each device. This also means that you can backup devices with different connector types and operating systems, including iOS, Android, Windows, Linux, and Mac OS, to the same cable as long as the MEEM cable can be plugged into one of the devices. Data can be shared and restored easily between devices. When the devices are connected over the Network, all slave devices can see the saved data in Your Data and can copy or save items to their device as they would if they were connected to it.</p>
<p>The MEEM Network also gives you even more peace of mind by allowing you to create a second backup of all your data on your computer. The computer needs to be connected to the same network as your device is, either through the WIFI or hardwire connection as well as have the MEEM Desktop application on it. The device will then backup the data stored on the cable to the computer. This can be configured to either copy the entire backup to the computer or just specific devices or categories from those devices, depending on your needs.</p>
<p>The MEEM Network offers a simple solution to backing up your devices simply over WIFI while still keeping your data safe and not exposing it to the cloud or the outside world.</p>

<p>What is the MEEM Network </p>
<p>Before reading this, please read the MEEM Cable and Mobile App User Guide for either iOS or Android and the MEEM Desktop Application User Guide. This will give you instructions for how to setup and use the MEEM app which is necessary before being able to use the MEEM Network. These user guides can be found on our Help page at the bottom under DOWNLOADS at https://www.meemmemory.com/help/</p>
<p>MEEM Network is part of the MEEM App and Cable package which allows you to backup and share data between up to 3 devices to the MEEM cable over WIFI. This makes backing up all your devices even easier and means you can backup multiple devices to a single cable at the same time, offering you more flexibility and convenience. You can also backup all device types and operating systems to one cable including iOS, Android, Windows*, Linux, and Mac OS over the network which means you can backup data from any platform and access it from any platform!</p>
<p>The MEEM Network allows you to backup the data on your MEEM cable to a computer over WIFI through the MEEM Desktop application. This means you can have a secondary backup of all your information as well as access to all of your backed up data from your computer.</p>
<p>If you owned your MEEM cable prior to the MEEM Network feature being available your MEEM cable will work with the MEEM Network. Just make sure you always have the latest MEEM app on your device to ensure you have the latest updates and improvements.</p>

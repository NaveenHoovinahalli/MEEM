<p>Understanding the App</p>
<p>The app will open on the main screen. Here you will see two boxes, one mirroring the other, which will show the name of your device; the box on the left (A)&nbsp;depicts your phone while the one on the right (B)&nbsp;represents the MEEM backup. Tapping either box will display a list of the categories (D)&nbsp;available to be backed up. The box on the right also displays the time since last backup (C).</p>

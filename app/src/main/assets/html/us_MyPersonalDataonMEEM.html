<p>MY PERSONAL DATA ON MEEM</p>
<p><img title="" src="images/PDM00.png" style="width:100%; height:auto" /></p>
<p>Your personal data stored on MEEM is protected because the cable is encrypted. The only way someone can access it from another phone is if you give them your PIN. After 10 consecutive incorrect PIN attempts the cable will be locked out. So if you lose your cable, don&rsquo;t worry, the data will always be secure.</p>

<p>Setting up your PIN is very easy. MEEM will prompt you the first time you use the cable to create a 4 digit PIN. For security, if you are connecting a new device you will have to enter your PIN. PLEASE SAVE YOUR PIN SOMEWHERE SAFE AS IT IS VITAL FOR USING MORE DEVICES WITH YOUR MEEM CABLE.</p>

<p>When you setup your PIN you will also be asked to answer 3 security questions. You must answer these questions as they will allow you to reset your PIN if you forget it. If you have forgotten your PIN and try to add another device you can press “Forgot PIN” on the screen. This will ask you the 3 security questions again. You will need to answer 2 of the security questions to authenticate the cable with your new device. Once you have authenticated the device you must go to the Settings menu and change your PIN. Please save these answers somewhere safe so you can connect new devices to it later if you forget your PIN. If you forget your PIN and security answers you will have no way to connect new devices to your cable.</p>

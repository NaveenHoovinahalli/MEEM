<p>Within the MEEM app there are two options for deleting saved data.
The first option is found within the Your Data menu. When viewing a category, you can tap &#34;Select&#34; at the top of the screen and select a specific number of items within that category. To delete those specifically chosen items, tap the trashcan icon, located at the top of the page next to the &#34;Cancel&#34; and &#34;Share&#34; buttons. This will permanently delete those items from your backup. </p>
<p>The second option is found within the Settings menu. Here you can access the delete function through the &#34;Delete backup data&#34; category on the screen. Select the backup that you would like to entirely delete at the top of the screen. Tapping the delete button at the bottom will allow you to delete the entire contents of any selected backup. After tapping the delete button, you will be asked if you are sure you would like to delete the selected data. By Tapping okay that data will be permanently deleted from your MEEM. </p>
<p>Notification (G)</p>
<p>Notification allows you to turn on and off the MEEM Notifications. Notifications from MEEM are sent every 24 hours after your last device backup to remind you to backup your device to the MEEM cable. If you do not wish to receive notifications you may turn them off here or in your deviceâ€™s settings menu.</p>
<p>MEEM Network (H)</p>

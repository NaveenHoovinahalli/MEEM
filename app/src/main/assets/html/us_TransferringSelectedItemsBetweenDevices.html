<p>Transferring Selected Items Between Devices</p>
<p>Instead of transferring entire categories between devices that are backed up onto a single MEEM cable, you can select individual items to transfer between devices, making it easy to share data between devices.</p>
<p>Always remember that you are transferring items from data stored on MEEM to the device that is currently plugged in. </p>
<p>Firstly, go to the Your data page where you will see all the devices backed up on the MEEM cable and select the icon of the device you want to transfer from. (A)</p>
<p><img title="" src="images/TSIBD00.png" style="width:100%; height:auto" /></p>
<p>You will now see the selected device&rsquo;s Your data page. Chose the category of the individual item(s) you want to transfer (B)&nbsp;and once in that category, press the Select button at the top of the screen and scroll through the contents choosing each item you want to share. </p>
<p>When you have selected everything you want in the category, press the Share icon (a box with an arrow pointing out to the top), which will bring up a prompt Add to Library.&nbsp;Press this prompt and all the selected items will be saved to the phone that the MEEM cable is currently plugged into. </p>

<p>Follow the same procedure for individual items in each category and the items will be saved to their respective folders on the device.</p>

<p>Multiple Devices</p>
<p>When connecting the MEEM cable to a new device the new device&rsquo;s icon will appear in green in the app. If other devices have been backed up to the MEEM cable, their icons will be shown in blue (A)&nbsp;above the new device&rsquo;s icon and on the right (representing they are backups on MEEM). The new device will now back up and be saved on MEEM as well. Up to three devices can be backed up onto one cable.</p>

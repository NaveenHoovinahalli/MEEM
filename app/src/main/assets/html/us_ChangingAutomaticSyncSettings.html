<p>Tap the phone or backup boxes to open the category list.</p>

<ul>
    <li>Backup with Archive Enabled: When the category is highlighted white with a +&nbsp;symbol after it, archive mode has been enabled. In archive mode, any items that are deleted from your device since the previous backup will not be deleted from your MEEM when backing up, allowing you to free space on your device while retaining the items on the cable. The archive data is stored in &ldquo;Archives&ldquo; on your cable.</li>
</ul>

<p>3. Saving Documents</p>
<p>To save documents from your device to MEEM, you must allow your device to share with the MEEM cable. </p>
<p>Make sure you have enabled the documents category within the MEEM app to Sync or Archive mode. Then, while viewing the document you want to back up to MEEM on your device, click the share button in the upper right hand corner of the screen to bring up the share options. On the share menu select Send a Copy&nbsp;followed by Send with Another&nbsp;App. Scroll all the way through the other application options to the button marked More. Within More&nbsp;you will see a list of all the applications you can share with and select MEEM. Once this is done, any time you press the share button while viewing a document the MEEM icon will be shown; simply click the Share to MEEM and the document will be backed up to MEEM&nbsp;upon the next backup. </p>

<p>Getting Started </p>
<p>First you will need to make sure that you have the MEEM app installed on all the devices you want to use on the Network. The limit is 3 devices including Master and Slave devices. To get the app on your mobile devices go to the respective app stores on your devices and download the MEEM app. Once you have the MEEM app on your devices you need to setup your MEEM cable. This is done by plugging the cable into one or your devices.</p>
<p>The very first time you plug your cable into a device you will be asked to setup a 4 digit PIN, the Master PIN. This is the only PIN you will ever need to setup with the cable and will be used to authorize all other devices on the cable. When asked for the PIN on slave devices and your computer please use this Master PIN. More information on the setup and use of the cable can be found in the MEEM Cable and Mobile App User Guide. These user guides can be found on our Help page at the bottom under DOWNLOADS at https://www.meemmemory.com/help/ </p>
<p>To link your other devices to the MEEM Network you will need to make sure they have the MEEM app on them and that it is open. You will then need to turn on the MEEM Network function. This can be found at the bottom of the Settings menu. You will then need to authenticate each device to allow if access to the MEEM cable through the network. To authenticate each device, you will be notified through the MEEM app that you need to enter the PIN you initially setup for the cable. There are two methods to authenticate the device.</p>
<ul>
    <li>The first method is done physically by plugging the cable into the device and entering the master PIN when requested to do so by the MEEM app. More information can be found in the MEEM Cable User Guide about this.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li>The second method is done over the MEEM Network and does not require the cable to be connected to that device, only the cable be connected to the Master device. After the cable is plugged into the Master device you need to open the MEEM app on the Slave device. The app will then search for and discover the Master device as long as it is on the same WIFI network. Once it has found the Master device it will ask for PIN authentication and prompt you to enter the Master 4 digit PIN.</li>
</ul>

<p>Once one of these methods has been completed the device is authenticated and connected to the MEEM Network for that MEEM Cable. You can then setup the backup options for that device either on the home screen or the Your Data menu as shown in the MEEM Cable User Guide.
</p>
<p>When the MEEM cable is physically plugged into the Master Device the MEEM app will automatically open and the backup will begin automatically for that device. For Slave devices, different operating systems will respond in different ways to the MEEM app</p>
<p>iOS: On iOS iPhones and iPads running as Slave devices you will need to open the MEEM app manually for the app to connect to the Master device and for the backup to begin running. The MEEM app needs to remain open during the entire backup on a slave device.</p>
<p>Android: On an Android smartphone or tablet running as a Slave device the MEEM app will open automatically after connecting the MEEM cable to the Master device. The MEEM app will open automatically and begin the backup. It does not need to be open during the backup on the Slave device for it to run.
</p>
<p>Windows: On an Windows smartphone or tablet running as a Slave device the MEEM app will open automatically after connecting the MEEM cable to the Master device. The MEEM app will open automatically and begin the backup. It does not need to be open during the backup on the Slave device for it to run.</p>
<p>During the backups you will be able to see the status of the backup at the top of the screen and will know when the backup has completed on each device.</p>
